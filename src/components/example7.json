Rose will now be an unrestricted free agent this summer.\n \nNew York may still look to re-sign Rose on a much cheaper contract. Rose has been a respected locker room veteran for the Knicks over the last few seasons.\n \nBy declining their option for Rose, New York will drop about $5.5 million below the luxury tax. That's likely to be only temporary, as Josh Hart is expected to decline his player option.",
